- Mobile app UI with Thai language
- Weather information and forecasts
- Field management interface
- Disease scanning placeholder
- Market prices display
- Bottom tab navigation

### Option 2: Expo Snack (Full Mobile Experience)
1. Go to [https://snack.expo.dev](https://snack.expo.dev)
2. Create new project
3. Copy code from `expo-snack-preview.js`
4. Add dependencies from `expo-snack-package.json`
5. Run and test on device/simulator

## 🎯 App Features Demonstrated

### 🏠 Home Screen

## 🔒 Security Features

### ✅ No Secrets in Mobile App
- All API keys removed from client code
- Server-side proxies for external APIs
- Environment-based configuration
- Automated secret scanning

### 🛡️ Server-Side Proxies Required
Your backend needs these endpoints:
- `GET /api/geocode?query=...` - Geocoding
- `GET /api/weather?lat=..&lng=..` - Weather data
- `POST /api/scan` - Disease detection
- `GET /api/prices?...` - Market prices

## 📋 Next Steps

### Immediate (Today)
1. **Review the web preview** in your browser
2. **Test the Snack version** on mobile device
3. **Share with stakeholders** for feedback
4. **Plan backend API development**

### Short Term (This Week)
1. **Set up backend server** with proxy endpoints
2. **Configure environment variables** for production
3. **Implement real camera** functionality
4. **Add data persistence** with AsyncStorage

### Medium Term (Next Month)
1. **Connect to real APIs** via server proxies
2. **Add user authentication** flow
3. **Implement push notifications**
4. **Prepare for app store** submission
