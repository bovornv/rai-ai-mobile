# 🌱 RAI • Web + Mobile 24-Month Launch Plan (Unicorn Path)

## 🎯 Core Strategy
- **Web (raiai.app)** = Funnel + Partner Hub → drive app downloads, host partner tools (shops, co-ops, banks).
- **Mobile App** = Habit Engine (Spray Window, Scan→Action, Tasks, Price Alerts) → daily farmer engagement.
- **Monetization Stack:**
  1. Freemium (Pro subs)
  2. Marketplace commission (inputs + crops)
  3. B2B data + API (insurers, banks, FMCG)
  4. Co-op/Shop SaaS tools (Counter Mode, analytics)
- **Expansion:** Thailand → Vietnam, Indonesia, Philippines, India by Month 18–24.
